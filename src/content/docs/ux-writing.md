System-level writing guidance. Sits above tactical copy rules (error messages, CTAs, empty states) and defines the consistent voice, the context-dependent tone, reading level, terminology, locale handling, and the patterns that make a product sound like itself.

Used by `/ui-craft:clarify` and anywhere agent-generated copy touches a user-facing surface.

## Voice vs tone

**Voice is constant. Tone varies.**

Voice is the product's personality — how it sounds whether you're reading onboarding, an error, or a paywall. Tone is how that voice adjusts to context: warmer in onboarding, restrained in success, explicit in destructive confirms. A product with consistent voice but responsive tone reads as designed; a product with shifting voice reads as written by 12 people.

## Voice matrix

Pick three axes. Lock a position on each. Deviations are deliberate (brand campaigns, April Fools), never accidental.

| Axis | Endpoints | Example anchors |
|---|---|---|
| Formality | Formal — Casual | Stripe formal; Mailchimp casual |
| Reverence | Reverent — Irreverent | Apple reverent; Slack irreverent |
| Expertise | Expert — Beginner-friendly | Datadog expert; Duolingo beginner |

Document the positions. "Casual-but-respectful, beginner-friendly, mildly irreverent" is a brief a writer can execute against. "Friendly" is not.

## Tone by context

Voice is fixed; tone moves along these contexts. Each row assumes a default voice of "casual-professional, beginner-friendly, restrained."

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Onboarding | Warm + specific | "Let's get your first project in. Takes 60 seconds." |
| Error — user-recoverable | Honest + actionable | "We couldn't save your draft. Retry, or copy the error for support: `abc-123`." |
| Error — system outage | Honest + transparent | "Search is down. We're investigating. Your data is safe." |
| Success | Restrained | "Changes saved." — not "Amazing work!" |
| Destructive confirm | Explicit about consequences | "Delete 3 items? You'll have 30 days to restore them from Trash." |
| Empty state | Action-oriented | "No integrations yet. Connect Slack, GitHub, or Linear to get started." |
| Paywall / limit | Informational, not shaming | "You're at 5/5 free projects. Upgrade to create more." |
| Danger zone (settings) | Neutral + precise | "Deleting the workspace removes all 47 projects and invalidates all API keys." |
| Waiting / latency | Honest about duration | "Generating report. Usually 20-40 seconds." |

Never: exclamation points on errors, emoji in enterprise contexts, celebratory copy on routine saves.

## Reading level

Target ~8th-grade (Flesch-Kincaid ~70+, grade ~8).

- Sentences <=20 words
- Paragraphs <=3 sentences
- Concrete nouns over abstractions ("invoice" beats "billing artifact")
- Active voice ("You signed in" beats "Sign-in was completed")
- One idea per sentence

Example rewrites:

| Before (grade 14) | After (grade 7) |
|---|---|
| "Upon successful authentication, users will be redirected to their personalized dashboard interface." | "You'll see your dashboard after you sign in." |
| "In the event that the operation is unsuccessful, please re-attempt the transmission." | "If it fails, try again." |
| "Configuration modifications will be persisted upon form submission." | "Your changes save when you click Save." |

## Terminology consistency

Every product needs a glossary. Same concept, same word, everywhere.

Common pitfalls:

- `user` / `member` / `account` / `seat` — pick one per concept and stick
- `project` / `workspace` / `board` — pick one per level of hierarchy
- `delete` / `remove` / `archive` / `trash` — these mean different things; don't alias
- `sign in` / `log in` — pick one (Apple uses `sign in`, Google uses `log in`; either is fine, mixing is not)
- `save` / `publish` / `update` — same action under three names in three surfaces is a finding

Red flag: in a review, grep the codebase for every verb on every button. If `Save` / `Update` / `Apply` appear on forms that do the same thing, file it.

## Inclusive language

Swap the loaded term for the neutral one. Keep the list tight — don't moralize, just fix.

| Replace | With |
|---|---|
| blacklist / whitelist | blocklist / allowlist |
| master / slave | primary / replica |
| sanity check | quick check |
| grandfathered | legacy |
| he / she (generic) | they |
| manhours / manpower | work hours / team capacity |
| man-in-the-middle | on-path attack |
| dummy value | placeholder value |
| first-class citizen | fully supported |

Don't soften to the point of vagueness — "on-path attack" is still precise; "bad thing happens in network" is not.

## Locale-aware strings

Rules agents routinely ignore. Every one is shippable to production the day the product adds a second locale.

- **Dates.** `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, options)`. Never hardcode `MM/DD/YYYY` unless the audience is exclusively US. Use `new Date().toLocaleDateString(locale, { dateStyle: 'medium' })` for user-facing dates.
- **Numbers and currency.** `Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency', currency })`. Decimal and thousands separators differ: `1,234.56` (US) vs `1.234,56` (DE) vs `1 234,56` (FR).
- **Plurals.** `Intl.PluralRules(locale)`. English has 2 forms; Russian has 3; Arabic has 6. Never `n === 1 ? "1 item" : n + " items"` — breaks in Polish, Arabic, Welsh.
- **Length tolerance.** German ~1.3x English; Russian ~1.2x; Chinese ~0.5x. Don't fix widths to English copy. Test with `de-DE` pseudo-locale.
- **RTL readiness.** Use logical CSS properties (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`, `border-inline-start`), not `margin-left`. `dir="rtl"` at the root should flip the UI without additional CSS.
- **Time zones.** Store UTC, display in the user's zone. Never assume server time is user time. Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, { timeZone })`.
- **Sorting.** `Intl.Collator(locale)` — alphabetical order is locale-dependent (Swedish sorts `a-ring` after `z`, German doesn't).

## Error copy anatomy

Three parts, in order: **what happened** + **why** + **what to do**.

- "Upload failed. The file is 62MB; the limit is 50MB. Try compressing it or splitting into parts."
- "We couldn't reach the server. Your internet looks offline. We'll retry automatically when you're back online."
- "Can't create the project. The name `beta` is already taken in this workspace. Try another name."

Missing pieces = bad error. "Something went wrong" has none of the three. "Invalid input" has only the first.

## CTAs

**Verb + noun.** Never `Submit`, `OK`, `Click here`, `Continue`.

| Generic | Specific |
|---|---|
| Submit | Create project |
| OK | Got it |
| Continue | Next: billing |
| Click here | Download invoice (PDF, 84KB) |
| Delete | Delete workspace |

Destructive actions include the object: "Delete `project-alpha`" — the user confirms the thing, not a generic verb. Typing the name for irreversible operations is the gold standard.

Action reveals consequence. "Send invite" tells the user exactly what happens. "Submit form" does not.

## Banned patterns

UX sins, not style choices.

- **Confirmshaming.** "No thanks, I don't care about security." Ship: "No thanks" as a plain link.
- **Fake urgency.** "Only 2 seats left!" when it's always 2. Ship: real counters or no counter.
- **Fake scarcity.** "87% of users upgraded" with no source. Ship: named, verifiable stats or omit.
- **Roach motel.** Easy signup, impossible cancellation. Ship: cancel in the same number of clicks as signup.
- **Dark toggles.** Opt-in checkboxes pre-checked for marketing emails. Ship: unchecked by default, unambiguous label.
- **Bait-and-switch pricing.** "$9/mo" that's actually "$9/mo, billed $108 annually, with a $29 setup fee." Ship: the total visible at decision time.

## Automation

Wire any of these to PR checks so copy regressions fail the build.

- **hemingwayapp.com** — manual spot check, grade-level scoring, passive-voice highlighter
- **`flesch` (npm)** — build-time check on user-facing strings
- **`write-good` (npm)** — flags weasel words, passive voice, lexical illusions
- **`alex` (npm)** — inclusive-language linter (catches the swap list above automatically)
